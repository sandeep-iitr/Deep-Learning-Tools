# Cloudlet

## [Short Paper 2013](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2465494)

### System Design Considerations
Mobile devices use cloud computing capabilities. A major bottleneck is the latency of the network. Cloudlet has emerged as a solution. Cloudlet is the middle tier of the three tier solution. 

## [Paper 2009: The Case for VM-Based Cloudlets in Mobile Computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5280678/)
A cloudlet is a computer or cluster of computer available for use by nearby mobile devices. 
- Paper has good motivational examples. Kind of idea of google glass. 
- Paper raises issues of static VM sysnthesis on cloud vs dynamic VM synthesis. In dynamic, peoposes a system which build using VirutalBox and uses scripts to start and stop the VM on the Cloudlet. synthesis a new VM in 60-100 seconds.
