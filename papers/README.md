# Deep learning and Neural Networks Concepts


## 1. Back Propagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition
- by Y LeCun.   Neural computation (1989)
- Introduces the concept of convolution neural network, filters and weigths. Main goal was to reduce the number of training 
parameters.

## 2. Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex.
- by David Hubel. The Journal of physiology (1959)
- Studies on cat brain shows, different neuron responds to different types of information/input and complexity is build from simple 
information to complex information in the visual processing pipeline of bilogical brain.
