# Deep learning and Neural Networks Concepts


## 1. Back Propagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition
- by Y LeCun.   Neural computation (1989)
- Introduces the concept of convolution neural network, filters and weigths. Main goal was to reduce the number of training 
parameters.

## 2. Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex.
- by David Hubel. The Journal of physiology (1959)
- Studies on cat brain shows, different neuron responds to different types of information/input and complexity is build from simple 
information to complex information in the visual processing pipeline of bilogical brain.

## 3. What size net gives valid generalization
- by Eric B. Baum. Advances in neural information processing systems. 1989
- Works on number of weights in the network, training examples, desired accuracy on the test examples drawn from same distribution as the training examples. For examples: To get an accuracy of 90%, we might need 10 times the number of training examples as the number of weights in the network.

## 4. DeCAF: A Deep Convolutional Activation Feature for Generic Visual Recognition
- by Jeff Donahue. International Conference on Machine Learning. 2014
